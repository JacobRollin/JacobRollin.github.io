# Portfolio Website
### Created by Jacob Rollin

This project is acting as a sort of 'capstone' where I can test my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. This will also serve as my actual portfolio website when it's finished.

## Planned Features
* Home Page with photo and brief personal description
* Portfolio page linking all projects to one, easily visible location
* Contact page for potential employers or interested parties
